**🛠️ SystemVerilog for Design and Verification Labs**

This repository chronicles my journey through the **SystemVerilog for Design and Verification Engineers Explorer Series v21.10** course offered by Cadence support. The course provides an in-depth introduction to the main SystemVerilog enhancements to the Verilog hardware description language (HDL), discussing the benefits of the new features, and demonstrating how design and verification can be more efficient and effective when using SystemVerilog constructs.

All lab exercises are implemented and simulated using **Xilinx Vivado**, leveraging its support for SystemVerilog constructs in synthesis and simulation!
